0.3.1:
* Fixed bug: If prechecking was enabled, it would only check against the local 
  database and skip the DNS lookups if no positives were detected. This allowed 
  IP addresses not in the database to access the site and still leave false 
  referrers.

0.3:
* Prechecking using the data in MySQL, no more lookups when it's not needed
* Fix of bug, discovered by Steven Lynn, that could result in false positive.

0.2:
* Logging of the last referrer given by an IP
* Rewrite of logging to MySQL which implies:
  - Previous gathered data is useless
  - IP addresses are now unique in database
  - Hits of IP addresses in the same row
  - Logging of the given referrer for review.
* Added exit code telling the site is protected by PHPrbl
